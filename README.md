# VATUK vatsys Sector File Project
The UK (EGTT and EGPX FIRs) vatsys Sector File project is an open source collaborative project to provide the highest quality sector file to VATSIM UK controllers.

A new sector file will be released in line with each AIRAC cycle (as long as significant changes warrant such as release).
